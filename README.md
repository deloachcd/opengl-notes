# OpenGL Notes
This repo stores as an infodump for me to store my raw notes on OpenGL and
graphics programming concepts. I have no plans doing anything to them
further than boosting the contrast on them in GIMP to make them easier to read
on a computer display, so what you see is what you get.

## How to view these
Go to the "wiki" tab, and select what you want to see from the sidebar.
